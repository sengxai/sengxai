<h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>

My name is Sengxai Yang I'm a graduate from UWEC with a degree in Computer Science - Software Engineering.
I have experiences within the cyber security field working with a SIEM based on ELK Stack.
I also have experiences as an information security analyst working with vulnerability reconnaissance, penetration testings (web-apps, mobile, internal/external networks, physical IDFs).

I have a passion for the growing and changing cyber security industry and I also like to develope software/apps that I am able to use or make life more easier.

In my repository are some projects of what I've done during my undergrad.
