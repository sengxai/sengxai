<h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>

My name is Sengxai Yang I'm a graduate from UWEC with a degree in Computer Science - Software Engineering.
I have experiences within both offensive and defensive side of cyber security.
I am currently learning the Spring Framework of how it makes building applications easier, quicker, and more secure.

I have a passion in tech and am eager to learn about many tools, software, and tech so I can make life more easier through code.

In my repository are some projects of what I've done during my undergrad(which may be archived) and other projects that I have finished or am currently working on.
