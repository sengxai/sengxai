<h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>

My name is Sengxai Yang and I am a senior graduating this Spring 2021 from UWEC with a degree in Software Engineering.
I am currently an Offense & Information Security Analyst for Learning & Technology Services at UWEC.

What I do I've done on the job is conduct pentests, evaluate security infrastructures, and remediate these security flaws.
I am interested in software developing such as web-apps, app seecurity, red-team, and blue team.

In my repository are some projects of what I've done during my undergrad.
